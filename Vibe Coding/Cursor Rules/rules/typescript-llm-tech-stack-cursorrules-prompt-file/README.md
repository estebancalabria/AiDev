It provides a unified API, enabling easy switching between providers and ensuring optimal utilization of various LLM features.TypeScript Functional Utility Library: A comprehensive library that offers utility functions, type aliases, and generics to enhance functional programming in TypeScript. It promotes immutability and composability, making it easier to write clean, maintainable code.Error Handling and Logging Framework: A framework specifically designed for enhancing error handling and logging in TypeScript applications. It incorporates custom error types and provides decorators for easy integration into existing codebases.Async Workflow Management Tool: A tool aimed at simplifying the management of asynchronous operations using async/await patterns. It offers advanced features like retry logic, timeout management, and race conditions detection.Developer Delight API Library: A library focused on creating delightful developer experiences through intuitive and highly composable APIs. It includes modules for common tasks like HTTP requests, data validation, and file operations.Type-Safe YAML Editor: An application that allows users to edit YAML files in a type-safe manner, leveraging the capabilities of js-yaml and TypeScript's strict type system to prevent common errors in configuration files.Mime-Type Management Service: A web service that offers advanced MIME type detection and mapping features, leveraging mime-types library to enhance file handling and content negotiation in web applications.UUID Management and Generation App: An application that provides advanced features for UUID generation and management, utilizing uuid library to ensure unique identifiers across distributed systems.Zod Schema Repository: A platform that hosts reusable zod schemas for common data validation use-cases, enabling developers to share and access validated and tested schemas for rapid application development.TypeScript Documentation Generator: A tool that automates the generation of comprehensive documentation for TypeScript projects, including examples and up-to-date information, by utilizing JSDoc comments and README files.

## Benefits


## Synopsis
Developers can leverage this prompt to create a well-structured TypeScript codebase for multi-provider LLM architectures with robust documentation, type safety, and efficient asynchronous operations.

## Overview of .cursorrules prompt
The .cursorrules file outlines guidelines and best practices for a software engineer and product manager with expertise in multi-provider architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs) and functional programming in TypeScript. It emphasizes coding standards, including naming conventions, file organization, and code style, advocating for the use of TypeScript's features like type aliases and generics. The file stresses the importance of the Single Responsibility Principle, dependency injection, error handling, and comprehensive unit testing. It also highlights documentation practices using JSDoc and the effective use of specific libraries (e.g., axios, js-yaml, mime-types, node-gyp, uuid, and zod) to enhance functionality and maintainability.

## What you can build
SvelteKit Project Starter Template: A template generator for quickly starting projects using SvelteKit, Supabase, and Drizzle. This tool would configure SSR, SSG, and real-time data with Supabase, leaving only customizations to be added by developers.Real-time Chat Application: A real-time chat application using SvelteKit and Supabase for authentication and Drizzle for state management. It would leverage SvelteKit's SSR capabilities to ensure fast loading times and seamless authentication transitions.E-commerce Platform: Build a scalable e-commerce platform with SvelteKit that utilizes Supabase for managing product inventory and user accounts. The solution would focus on SSR for efficient server-side rendering of product pages with SSG for converting high-traffic pages into static content.Personal Blogging Website: A lightweight blogging platform using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. The website would support static site generation with dynamic content sections, allowing authors to edit and publish articles dynamically via a Supabase backend.Multi-language Content Management System (CMS): Implement a CMS with SvelteKit and Paraglide.js that supports internationalization and dynamic content loading through Supabase. The CMS would include simple mechanisms for creating and managing content across multiple languages.Task Management Application: A SvelteKit-based task management app utilizing Supabase for real-time collaboration and Drizzle for frontend state management. The app would feature dynamic updates and SSR for decreased load times.User Authentication Template: A collection of SvelteKit components and templates that allow developers to implement complex authentication flows, such as OAuth and PKCE, using Supabase's authentication features.Online Portfolio Creator: A tool that enables users to create their online portfolios using SvelteKit, customizable Shadcn components, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The platform would utilize Supabase for content storage and dynamic site rendering.Interactive Data Dashboard: Create a dashboard application using SvelteKit and Supabase, optimized for SSR and static content when appropriate, that displays real-time analytics and reports from a Supabase database, offering teams a collaborative interface.Event Management System: Develop an event management system using SvelteKit with functionalities like scheduling, attendee registration, and live updates via Supabase. The system would utilize SSR for efficient page rendering and load functions for data fetching.SEO Optimized Blogs Generator: An app that allows bloggers to create SEO-optimized blog posts with meta tags management using SvelteKit's Svelte:head component and SSR for fast content delivery.SvelteKit Component Library: A library of reusable components designed with Svelte 5, Shadcn components, and Tailwind CSS, which developers can quickly integrate into any SvelteKit project.Supabase Starter Kit: A toolkit providing best-practice configurations for using Supabase with SvelteKit, including authentication flows, real-time features, and database optimizations. This kit would help developers quickly bootstrap their applications with minimal setup.Responsive Web App Framework: Create a responsive web application framework utilizing SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, focused on performance optimization, for developers building cross-platform mobile and desktop apps.Dynamic Form Builder: A GUI-based dynamic form builder using SvelteKit, with built-in validation, server-side form handling, and Supabase integration for storing submitted data. This tool would enable the creation and management of complex form workflows without coding expertise.

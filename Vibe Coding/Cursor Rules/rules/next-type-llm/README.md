## What you can build

### Interactive Coding Assistant for Learning

A web application using the specified stack that offers interactive coding lessons and exercises for new developers, integrating LLMs for real-time feedback, explanations, and step-by-step guides in TypeScript. It could allow users to write code in the browser, receive feedback, and see examples in action.

### AI-Powered Code Review Tool

Develop an online platform where developers can submit their code for AI-assisted review using LLMs. The tool would analyze the codebase, provide suggestions for improvements, detect potential errors, and follow best practices, thus enhancing code quality and performance.

### Automated Documentation Generator

Create a service that utilizes LLMs to automatically generate comprehensive and clear documentation from codebases written in TypeScript, with explanations of each function's purpose, parameters, and typical use cases.

### AI-Driven Bug Fixing Service

A platform where developers can submit code snippets with bugs, and LLMs will analyze and suggest fixes. Integration with the frontend and backend as described will ensure smooth operation, suggesting changes directly to TypeScript code.

### Collaborative Coding Environment

Build a real-time collaborative coding platform using Next.js that allows multiple users to edit the same codebase, with live feedback and suggestions from LLM integration, similar to Google Docs for coding.

### Personalized Learning Path Generator

An application offering custom learning paths for developers based on their current skill level and desired goals. It uses LLMs to tailor course content and provides exercises in TypeScript, paralleled by interactive examples in Next.js.

### AI Chatbot for Code Optimization

Develop a chatbot using LLMs integrated into a web app where developers can paste code snippets to get optimization tips and refactoring suggestions to increase efficiency and performance.

### AI-Powered UI/UX Improvement Adviser

A service that takes existing Next.js projects and uses LLMs to suggest improvements in UI/UX, leveraging Tailwind CSS for design enhancements and Lucide React for improved iconography aesthetics.

### Customized Tutorial Creator

A tool that automatically creates tutorials based on the codebase input, using LLMs to form readable, step-by-step guides for specific programming tasks or app functionalities in Next.js and TypeScript.

### Smart Codebase Search Engine

Implement a search engine specifically for codebases, allowing developers to enter queries in natural language to locate relevant code segments. It uses LLMs to understand the intent and context of the queries, providing accurate results.

## Benefits

- Holistic rule-based approach for requirement comprehension ensures code meets all project needs and fits seamlessly in the existing stack.
- Clear coding standards prioritize performance, security, and modularity while maintaining a balance between verbosity and brevity.
- Emphasizes a step-by-step coding process, with accountability via TODO comments, for methodical progress and high-quality outcomes.

## Overview of .cursorrules prompt

The .cursorrules file outlines a set of guidelines and procedures for assisting with software development tasks. It emphasizes a holistic understanding of the tech stack, including front-end and back-end technologies, such as Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Python for LLM integration. It promotes modularity, DRY principles, performance, and security in coding style. The coding process is methodical, with an emphasis on step-by-step reasoning and prioritization of tasks. Detailed guidelines for editing code, coding verbosity levels, and a structured response format for the assistant are also included. The assistant acts as a senior pair programmer, offering expertise in the programming language used, and provides a concise summary of requirements and code history. Deployment strategies are yet to be determined.

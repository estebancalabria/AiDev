## Overview of .cursorrules prompt
The .cursorrules file outlines a system for enhancing a z80 cellular automata simulation by introducing a higher-level control structure called the "environmental region grid." This structure allows users to define and manipulate larger areas within the simulation, referred to as regions, which can influence the behavior of underlying "soup cells." The regional grid can be configured in varying sizes (4x4, 8x8, 16x16) for different levels of granularity. Regions have adjustable parameters such as obstacles, directional influence, randomness, temperature, and energy levels that dynamically modify cell behavior. Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting these parameters in real-time, and changes are visually represented. The file provides a step-by-step plan to implement this system, including creating data structures, mapping cells to regions, modifying the simulation loop, enhancing the WebAssembly interface, developing user interfaces, and synchronizing data between frontend and backend components. This approach allows for complex user-defined behaviors and enhances the depth and interactivity of the simulation.
